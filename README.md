SlowLang is a semi-eso programming language I designed just for fun.<br>
Right now it doesn't have a lot of functionality. Basically everything you can do is infinite loops, input, output, getting the current Time and variables.

SlowLang is an interpreted language which is based on the [SlowLangEngine](https://github.com/zenonet/SlowLangEngine).<br>
The parser of SlowLangEngine is pretty extendable so if you want, you can create more cool statements and create a pull-request.<br>If you need help, just 
[create an Issue](https://github.com/zenonet/SlowLang/issues/new).

<h1>Hello World</h1>
You can write a hello world script in SlowLang like this:

```
print("Hello World!");
```
The semicolon is completely optional.
