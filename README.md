SlowLang is a semi-eso programming language I designed just for fun.<br>
Right now it doesn't have a lot of functionality. Basically everything you can do is infinite loops, input, output, getting the current Time and variables.

SlowLang is an interpretet language which uses a self written regex-based lexer and a self written parser.<br>
The parser is pretty extenable so if you want, you can create your own statements and create a pull-request. <br >If you need help, just 
[create an Issue](https://github.com/zenonet/SlowLang/issues/new).

<h1>Hello World</h1>
You can write a hello world script in SlowLang like this:

```
print("Hello World!");
```
The semicolon is completely optional.
